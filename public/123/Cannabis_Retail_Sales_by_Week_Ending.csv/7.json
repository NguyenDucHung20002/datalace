the Adult-Use Average Product Price is expected to increase slightly over the period from October 1, 2023, to October 10, 2023. The predicted prices range from 37.806595 to 38.075127. \n\n- The prediction method used is the Prophet Forecasting Model, which is a decomposable time series model with three main components: trend, seasonality, and holidays. This model is similar to a generalized additive model (GAM), a class of regression models with potentially non-linear smoothers applied to the regressors. \n\n- The Prophet Forecasting Model is a flexible tool that can easily accommodate seasonality with multiple periods and allows the analyst to make different assumptions about trends. It does not require the measurements to be regularly spaced, and it does not need to interpolate missing values e.g. from removing outliers. \n\n- The model is also fast to fit, allowing the analyst to interactively explore many model specifications. The forecasting model has easily interpretable parameters that can be changed by the analyst to impose assumptions on the forecast. \n\n- The Prophet Forecasting Model was introduced by Facebook and is designed for making forecasts for univariate time series datasets. It is particularly effective at capturing complex patterns in the data such as seasonality, trends, and the effect of holidays. \n\n- For more information on the Prophet Forecasting Model, you can refer to the following resources: \n  - \ud83d\udcda [Introduction to Prophet](https://www.google.com/search?q=introduction+to+prophet+forecasting+model)\n  - \ud83d\udcca [The Prophet Library](https://www.google.com/search?q=prophet+library+for+time+series+forecasting)\n  - \ud83d\udcc8 [Facebook's Prophet](https://www.google.com/search?q=facebook%27s+prophet+for+time+series+forecasting)\n  - \ud83d\udcc9 [FBProphet](https://www.google.com/search?q=fbprophet+time+series+forecasting+algorithm)\n  - \ud83d\udcc5 [Prophet for Seasonal Effects](https://www.google.com/search?q=prophet+for+forecasting+seasonal+effects)"}
